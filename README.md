The challenge that promoters and marketing experts faced at the time is their scepticism about the validity of this influencer depending on a number of factors. Among the challenges - many - that have occurred in the influencer marketing arena since its appearance in 2006, is the emergence of social media platforms little by little in the picture such as Facebook and Twitter, which Instagram joined later in 2010, According to the January 2019 We Are Social Report, 3.484 billion people actively use social media - that's 45% of the world's population. These people inevitably look to social media influencers to guide their decisions. You can separate different types of social media influencers in multiple ways.
